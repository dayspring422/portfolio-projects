# PicSavior – AI-Powered Photo Curation App
*(macOS & iOS · SwiftUI · CoreML · TensorFlow · OpenCV · Vision)*

## Overview
PicSavior is a multi-model AI app that automates photo selection by scoring images on **sharpness, face detection, emotion analysis, and aesthetics (NIMA)**. Built natively in SwiftUI, it reduces manual curation time and is prepared for App Store deployment.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid AI pipeline**: CoreML + Vision, TensorFlow (NIMA), OpenCV, DeepFace  
- **Weighted composite ranking** to select best photos  
- **<0.5s/image** inference on-device for real-time feedback  
- Sorting & filtering by sharpness, face count, location, capture time  
- Optimized SwiftUI UI (responsive grid, export tools)

## Impact
- Manual review time reduced by **~85%**  
- **~88%** agreement with human aesthetic choices

## Tech Stack
SwiftUI, CoreML, Vision, TensorFlow (NIMA), OpenCV, DeepFace, Core Image
